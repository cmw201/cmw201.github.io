<center><h2> Week 5 - Maribor, Slovenia </h2></center>
<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Excursion to Piran, Lake Bled, and Ljublijana </h3>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> We kick-started our week in Slovenia with a trip all around the country, which is about the size of New Jersey. We visited Postojna Cave, Predjama Castle, Lake Bled, and the capital city of Slovenia, Ljublijana. Despite being the biggest city in Slovenia, the population is only around 300,000 people. This city exemplifies the smaller communities in Europe versus the United States.</p>

<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Nursing Home Site Visit </h3>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"><img src=./nursing.jpeg width=175 style="float:right; margin-left: 15px; margin-right:20px;">The nursing home visit was very different than what I was expecting and accustomed to in the United States. My first impression was how clean the facility was, it was colorfully decorated, and was brightly lit. It has a scenic location at the base of a mountain. The residents were walking around and conversing with each other, they seemed very content to be there. The facility provides many types of therapies to their residents such as occupational therapy, physical therapy, and animal therapy. The residents are encouraged to keep up with activities they enjoyed in their younger lives and many take on responsibilities that they would have had previously. For example, one resident owned a farm and is not in charge of taking care of the sheep. Numerous other residents help with gardening. The home has an on-site garden where they grow their own food. In the event of excess, they sell the produce to bring in money for the home. The home has many advanced physical therapies, however, Austrian law dictates there is one therapist per 150 people. This is a huge patient load for one professional, and the man we talked to said he is very overwhelmed. While Austria, and many other countries are going through a healthcare professional shortage right now, this lack of staff comes down to lawmakers. The lawmakers are making rules about subjects they do not have first-hand knowledge about. While many therapists are trying to change these laws, there has been no progress made so far. I see similarities in the way healthcare professionals are ignored in the U.S. even when laws enacted put patients or professionals in danger.</p>
<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Medical Center Site Visit </h3>
<p style= "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> <img src=./fountain.jpeg width=175 style="float:right; margin-left:20px;margin-right: 15px;">The Medical Center was different than any other site visit. The center focuses more on holistic medicine and all of their services are centered around the water from springs that flow down from the mountains surrounding Maribor. We tried the water from the springs, which has high magnesium content making it special. The woman we talked to said that the high mineral content makes the water "alive." There was both warm and cold water, the warm for digestive health and the cold for relaxation. To the right, you can see a picture of one of the fountains where the water came out. The center provides regular doctors appointments, dental services, and surgery. The center is mostly used by rich people from other countries who come for a spa vacation, rather than the citizens of Maribor. </p>
<h3 style = "color:#957DAD;margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Crystal Producing Factory Site Visit </h3>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Rogaška is a crystal producing company that makes products for luxury brands such as Versace and Tiffany. They also manufacture parts for the New Year's Eve ball in Times Square. After visiting Andritz during week 3, I was expecting similar safety measures from Rogaška. I found this to not be the case, I saw many people working without gloves or without masks despite being around welding material and dangerous chemical debris. Based on how little safety guidance we were given in comparison to Andritz, I do not think that safety and prevention are top priorities for the company. I know the stakes a lower with crystal versus turbines at Andritz, but there was still heavy machinery and other workplace hazards.
<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Old Pharmacy Site Visit </h3>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> The pharmacy we visited was a former fortress before becoming a monastery and then later an apothecary. The monks who lived in the fortress were masters of herbal medicine and used many plants similar to the ones we saw at the botanical gardens. The general reliance on herbal medicine is prevalent throughout Austria and Slovenia, but here I got to see the context under which people were being treated. The long history of monasteries as places of medical treatment is evident in this building. The medical treatment that people expected was herbs, and to some extent this is still true in apothekes in Austria and Slovenia.</p>

<h3 style = "color:#957DAD;margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> UKC (University Clinical Center) Site Visit </h3>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> At the UKC, we were introduced to European Union technological innovation. We met a nurse robot that has been performing responsibilities of nurses such as taking temperatures, recording symptoms, and entertaining patients. The robot even sang happy birthday to us! The project is funded by the European Union as a pilot project for now, until these robots are proven to be able to work by themselves. At the center, we spoke with nurses who talked to use about the staff shortages that they are facing. Many nurses being educated in Slovenia leave to work in Austria because they are paid better and the working conditions are better. This leaves Slovenia with a dangerous staff shortage that puts their patients at risk. This is similar in the U.S. where many nurses from smaller, less wealthy countries such as the Philippines, come to work in the U.S. leaving their home countries without staff.</p>
