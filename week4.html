<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Botanical Gardens site visit </h3>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> <img src=./garden1.jpeg width=150 style= "float:right; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 20px;">We visited the botanical gardens in Graz to learn about medicinal plants. When people first started treating diseases, they thought that there was a plant to treat every disease. Thus, they started recorded what plants alleviated what symptoms. They measured disease in terms of wet/dry and hot/cold. The purification and synthesis of drugs from plants came much later in history. I learned that many of the medicinal plants were dangerous to use because the amount had to be measured very  carefully in order to ensure proper dosage. Today, apothekes visit the botanical gardens to use their plants in medicines for patients. Austria and Slovenia both utilize independently-owned apothekes that can provide mixtures, pills, and teas that use herbs. The use of holistic and herbal medicine is a strong tradition in Europe, unlike in the U.S.</p>



<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Hallstatt Day Trip </h3>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Our trip to Hallstatt had an early start, but the views made it all worth it! We spilt off from the class, into a group of seven to make the three hour train ride to Hallstatt. Hallstatt is the town that the movie Frozen is based off of and is a must see when in Austria. When we arrived, we took a ferry across the lake, which is the only way to access the the town. We began with a harder than expected hike to the viewing platform that was about thirty minutes from the main town. At the viewing platform, we got a great view of the waterfall and the town below. From the view we could see the Alps surrounding the town. If we had more time, we would have hiked to the top to see the salt mines that were crucial to the early Celtics and Romans who inhabited Hallstatt. Since we did not have time to go all the way to the top, we hiked back down and explored the city. In the city, I made sure to pick up some souvenirs of salt that Hallstatt is known for. While walking around, I noticed tons of signs warning tourists that real people live in this town and we need to act respectfully. The once secluded Hallstatt was popularized by Frozen, but it is clear many residents would have liked the town to stay a hidden treasure. While in Hallstatt, I was thinking about how difficult it must be for residents to access healthcare since they are so remotely located. I did not see any doctors offices when walking around the town, not even a general practitioner. I wonder if the people of Hallstatt have any emergency medical services nearby or how feasible it is to make it to a hospital. </p>

<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> At the end of this week, after our final exam, we spent the last day exploring Graz and packing up our belongings to board the bus to Maribor the next day.</p>
