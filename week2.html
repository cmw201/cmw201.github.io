<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Transplant Surgery site visit </h3> 
<img src=./scrubs.jpeg width=140 style=" float:right; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 20px;"> </img> 
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> This site visit was one of the most interesting experiences I had on this trip and something I will remember for a long time to come. Our class got to scrub in and watch two real surgeries in LKH. The first involved removing an insulinoma, a tumor in the pancreas. The second was a robotic surgery wherein the doctor controlled a robot that was working on the patient remotely. I got to try out a simulation on the exact same machine the doctor was using as if I was the surgeon. This was the first time I have ever been in an operating room or watching a surgery first-hand and it blew me away. </p>

<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Marienambulanz Caritas </h3> 
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">Marienambulanz provides basic healthcare to people without insurance. They also provide the community with healthy food such as fresh fruits. The healthcare provided is very basic but it is all people without insurance have access to. They have specialist doctors who visit on certain days of the week and a dentist. Marienambulanz has a social worker to help the clients with larger issues that may be impacting why people do not have access to healthcare. They attempt to help immigrant families integrate into Austrian society. Before visiting, my impression was that everyone in Austria was able to get healthcare through the government, but this is not true. Places like Marienambulanz are necessary for those without insurance. It is funded by both donations and federal funding.</p>
<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Mayor's Lunch </h3> 
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> We visited the Mayor's office in Graz. We met with a city councilman who talked about the reforms and goals of the mayor's administration. The mayor in Graz is a communist. She and many people who work with her feel that they are paid too much, so they keep a portion of their income and give the rest back to the city. The main goals of the administration are affordable housing. Safe and clean housing plays a role in the health of citizens. The approach to housing and it's impact on health being the responsibility of the community is different than in the U.S.</p>
<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Mosaik site visit </h3> 
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Mosaik provides people with disabilities with many services and supports their family members. Some of the services included are daycare for children, employment opportunities, mobile services, and various therapies including ranging from physical to music and art. Mosaik supports clients of all ages with disabilities, including those as young as pre-schooled aged. During our tour, we saw the facilities available to grade school-aged children. There were interactive rooms for play and relaxation as well such as a room with a water bed, a light and dark room, and an accessible playroom. During this tour, I thought about how we do not have institutions like this in the U.S. Many younger people with disabilities whose families are unable to care for them are regulated to nursing homes with elderly individuals and do not have these services that would allow them to live with people their own age. In class, we talked about how institutions like Mosaik existed in America until the 1970s. However, many were shut down in order to favor the integration of those with disabilities into "typical" society. The Americans with Disabilities Act favored the mainstreaming of education and integration into society rather than segregation. The thought process was that if people with disabilities have employment, then employers will cover their healthcare costs, which lowers the cost burden on Americans. While the issue of cost is important, this also coincides with the moral issue of not hiding those with disabilities and giving them the services they need to succeed in mainstream society. In my opinion, a combination of the Austrian and American models of caring for those with disabilities is needed. The Austrian model makes innovative technologies accessible to those who need them and caters to those with disabilities in a way that is very uncommon in the American system.

<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Piber Day Trip </h3>
<img src=./food.jpeg width=160 style= "float:right; margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 20px;"></img> 
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> In the morning, we visited the UNESCO intangible cultural heritage site of the Lipizzaner horses. Piber is where the horses are bred and raised for the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. Only the best horses are chosen to be bred. </p>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">After, we visited an independently-owned apotheke where we learned how patients get their medicines, price caps, and the structure of apothekes in Austria. In order to get prescription medication, the process is very similar to that of the U.S. The doctor writes a prescription and the pharmacists either makes the medication on-site or the medication is pre-bought. In the Austrian system, access to medication for everyone is valued highly, thus prescription medication has a price cap of about six euros. This means that no matter how much the medication would cost, the patient only has to pay six euros.</p>
<p style= "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Later in the day, we visited the Buschenschank. All of the food we ate was grown on the premises including the meat. The food was very fresh and even the juice we had was from fruits grown right there. I knew that the food in Austria was fresher but this is as fresh as it gets. I had never know places like this existed, while there are "organic" restaurants in the U.S. they are few and far between, and none that I am aware of claim to make 100% of their ingredients on site.</p>

<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Notube site visit </h3> 
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Notube helps children with eating disorders and medical issues that prevent eating without a tube  
The goal of Notube is to help children eat normally without a tube. The services they provide are available to children all over the world, with an emphasis on telemedicine. The services provided are not covered by insurance and instead people must pay out of pocket. When I asked the doctor who runs Notube about how they support families without access to healthy food both during and after treatment, she said that this was not a consideration because "we only treat those with the means to pay; children of doctors and lawyers." I was surprised by how blunt she was and the implication that poor children do not struggle with these same issues or are not worthy of the same resources. For a country that touts medical care for all, it was puzzling to me that they draw the line at something as basic as eating. </p>


<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Opera </h3> 
<p style= "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> We visited the opera house in Graz to see "The Florentine Hat." This was an experience. The opera was in Italian and the subtitles were in German. I had some trouble following along, but in these moments I paid attention to context clues such as facial expressions and lighting to understand the mood of the scene. </p>
<h3 style = "color:#957DAD; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"> Free Weekend - Croatia </h3> 
<div>
<p style = "margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">We spent our free weekend on the relaxing beaches of Rijeka, Croatia. We left Graz early Friday morning and took a Flixbus about five hours south to Rijeka. Upon arrival, we walked about thirty minutes to our hostel which was slightly outside of center city. We soon realized that the little German we knew would not be much help in Rijeka. We intended to use google translate our whole stay there, but were pleasantly surprised that almost everyone we met spoke English. One waiter approached us and said "Do you want Croatian, German, English, or French?" Unlike Graz, Rijeka was very tourist friendly, as most of their revenue comes from tourism. I noticed that their menus were in Croatian, but included English and German translations right underneath for every dish. The restaurants and stores were also open much later, I wonder if this is a cultural difference between Croatia and Austria, or if this is because of the tourism industry.</p>
